# INVISPA

Invi, "A Simple Invoicing App"; and that's literally it!
The intention is just to keep a simple task simple. Enjoy invoicing!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Version 1.*

Version 1.* (including Beta) has the core functionality with the same look n feel for all screen sizes; however, it'll be responsive.

## Upcoming Versions

Later versions will have:
- A hamburger menu at the usual left corner of the nav-bar.
  - There is a possiblility to have this in version 1.*.
  - This menu will contain any additional info like "About" section, "Help" section, or settings.
  - The basic settings will be decorated directly in the top area of the hamburger menu.
  - The advanced settings will be tucked into the "Spice it up" ðŸŒ¶ section.
- Wide layout with a table like display and rows with smaller height.
  - Current layout will be termed as "narrow layout".
- Ability to switch between narrow and wide layout.
  - Most probably there will be a button for this purpose that'll appear only on larger screens; where it makes sense ðŸ¤“.
    - The placement of this button will be in the middle of the nav-bar.
